# Cauchy tests

Tests on the standard Cauchy 1d distribution are here. Each subdirectory contains results for different tests.

### Directory roadmap
* `cauchy1d_old` contains the results used for the final project of STAT520A (will delete)
* `cauchy1d_original` contains the results of 10 runs of Cauchy ran locally
* `cauchy1d_arc` contains the results of 20 runs of Cauchy ran in ARC Sockeye
* `cauchy1d_merge` contains the merged results of the 10 local runs and the 20 ARC Sockeye runs
