## Directory roadmap

Each directory contains its own README file. In general:
- `lbvi` contains the main functions used for L-BVI Bayesian inference
- `examples` contains self-contained examples that approximate one of the target distributions in its `targets` subdirectory
- `tests` contains tests used for the paper; see README within for reproducibility
