# Self-contained examples

Each subdirectory contains multiple examples, which can be run by running the bash script. More information can be found on the README file inside each subdirectory.

### Directory roadmap
* `normal-kernel` contains examples with Gaussian kernels
* `other-kernel` contains examples with non-Gaussian kernels
* `targets` contains the targets that are approximated in the examples
